[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nomacs/nomacs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nomacs/nomacs)

## Build nomacs (Windows)

### Compile dependencies

- `Qt` SDK or the compiled sources (>= 5.2.1)
- [expat](https://github.com/nomacs/expat) (needed for exiv2)
- [Exiv2](https://github.com/nomacs/exiv2) (>= 0.26)
- [OpenCV](https://github.com/TUWien/opencv) (>= 3.4) _optional_
- [LibRaw](https://github.com/nomacs/LibRaw) (>= 0.17) _optional_
- [QuaZip](https://github.com/nomacs/quazip) (>= 0.7.6) _optional_
- `Python` (>= 3.6) for build scripts

### Compile LibRaw

- only needed if ENABLE_RAW is checked
- clone [libraw](https://github.com/nomacs/LibRaw)
- checkout to the latest `0.XX-stable` branch
- follow the build instructions
- in the nomacs `CMakeUserPaths.cmake`, add the build path to `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}`

### Compile nomacs

- copy `CMakeUserPathsGit.cmake` and rename it to `CMakeUserPaths.cmake`
- add your library paths to the `${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}` in `CMakeUserPaths.cmake`
- Open CMake GUI
- set your ImageLounge folder to `where is the source code`
- choose a build folder (i.e. `build2017-x64`)
- Hit `Configure`then `Generate`
- Open the Project
- Right-click the nomacs project and choose `Set as StartUp Project`
- Compile the Solution

### If anything did not work

- check if you have setup opencv (otherwise uncheck ENABLE_OPENCV)
- check if your Qt is set correctly (otherwise set the path to `qt_install_dir/qtbase/bin/qmake.exe`)
- check if your builds proceeded correctly

## Build nomacs (Ubuntu)

Get the required packages:

``` console
sudo apt-get install debhelper cdbs qt5-qmake qttools5-dev-tools qt5-default qttools5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qt5-image-formats-plugins libexiv2-dev libraw-dev libopencv-dev cmake libtiff-dev libquazip5-dev libwebp-dev git build-essential lcov libzip-dev
```

Get the nomacs sources from github:
``` console
git clone https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs.git
```

This will by default place the source into ~/nomacs
Go to the nomacs/ImageLounge directory and run `cmake` to get the Makefiles:
``` console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DUSE_SYSTEM_QUAZIP=ON ..
```

Compile nomacs:
``` console
make
```

You will now have a binary (~/nomacs/build/nomacs), which you can test (or use directly). To install it to /usr/local/bin, use:
``` console
sudo make install
```

note that you have to execute
``` console
sudo ldconfig
```

on your own after a successfully install

### For Package Maintainers

- Set `ENABLE_TRANSLATIONS` to `true` (default: `false`)
- Build all officially supported [plugins](https://github.com/nomacs/nomacs-plugins/)

## Build nomacs (MacOS)

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) for easier installation of dependencies.
Install required dependencies:

``` console
$ brew install qt5 exiv2 opencv libraw quazip cmake pkg-config
```

Go to the `nomacs` directory and run cmake to get the Makefiles:

``` console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ Qt5_DIR=/usr/local/opt/qt5/ cmake -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin ../ImageLounge/.
```

Run make:

```console
$ make
```

You will now have a binary (`nomacs.app`), which you can test (or use directly). To install it to `/usr/local/bin`, use

```console
$ sudo make install
```
